WEBVTT

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.720
What do you like in France?
The food is very good.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.600
The tower I think is extraordinary,
every time  I pass by the tower,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.520
I am left gobsmacked.
Saying "how beautiful", how

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.040
can something be so beautiful.  The
weather can be quite bad at times,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.600
because I don't like cold,
but you get used to it.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.160
We don't know much about you, we know
that you are a genius with the ball.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.240
Would you say that
it's a gift from God?

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.680
I think so. I think it's a gift
that God gave me to play football.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.160
Obviously I had to make some
sacrifices to realise my dreams,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.200
so I'm very grateful to God
for giving me this gift,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.840
because football is a passion
that I've had since I was little

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.200
and I'm going to make the most
of it for the rest of my life.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.800
At what age did you discover
that you had something that
other youngsters didn't?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:27.440
I would say around eight years old
is when people started to see that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.960
I had something different. There was
one time in a tournament and in

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.560
the game, I think I scored eight
or nine goals. I picked the ball up

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.920
and dribbled past the goalkeeper,
scored and I went and hugged my dad.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.240
I got to the fourth, fifth goal and
he didn't want to hug any more and I

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.760
was embarrassed because the other
dads were saying that I played alone,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.360
I didn't play for anyone else.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.960
And then when I hugged him he would
say no. Then they started to realise

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.920
that I had different quality compared
to the other players of my age.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.840
Today, you are a global star,
admired and celebrated.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.360
one of the best paid
players in the world.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.320
The glory of a poor child in Brazil.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.760
At that time, you lived
in a poor neighbourhood.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.640
I was raised in a neighbourhood, that
was practically a favela in Brazil,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.080
thank God we never went hungry.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.200
Obviously we wanted something
more for ourselves.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.400
I had a little something

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.840
that I wanted

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.160
that we couldn't buy
because we had no money.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.360
I lived with my grandmother,
in my grandmother's house,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.000
there were nine of us,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.080
we slept in a room much
smaller than this space here.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.080
It was me, my sister, my mother and
my father, but it was one of the best

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.800
moments of my life, that I enjoyed a
lot, playing in the street, meeting

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.720
my friends and playing football
in the middle of the favela. I had

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.680
a great time learning and thank God
with my gift of playing football,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:17.440
I was able to take my family
out of this life of difficulties
and give them a better life.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.800
You said that at home you had food
but nothing else, your mother didn't

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.920
have the means to buy you cookies.
Can you tell us more?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.000
Once we went to the supermarket.
I wanted a cookie and my mother

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.840
said that I couldn't buy a
cookie because she had no money.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.440
She went with the
money to buy us food.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.760
When she told me that, I said okay.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.000
So I'll be very rich,
I'll buy the cookie factory and then

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.760
she started laughing, because you
know, a child dreams a little.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.080
But she laughed at the time and this
story ended up happening, she gets

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:16.600
emotional even today when I say that,
I think it touched her a lot.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.960
Your father worked at the factory,
he dreamed of taking his family out

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.800
of the difficulty through football.
You fulfilled his dream?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.760
In fact, it's obvious that
anyone's dream is to get the

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.280
family out of trouble, to give a
better life to the whole family.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.120
My father's dream started when
he was a professional footballer,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.920
unfortunately he didn't
have a successful career.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.040
He managed to play for some clubs.
Then he started working in Santos.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.280
He worked with mechanics, repairing
motorcycles and company cars.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.760
He wanted to help me,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.040
we got by with what he had,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.080
his work helped a lot at home,
with a basic salary,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.880
with the money he earned,
and thank God, it was awarded to me.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.120
We joke about it a lot today.
We get along very well,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.600
we talk a lot and joke together.
I am very grateful to

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.160
him, my family,
my mother and my sister, my friends.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.320
Everyone who helped me to get
where I am, because it is not easy.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.000
A lot of people see you at the top
and think it's easy to get to the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.280
top. It's not, it's complicated.
You have to fight a lot and then

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.120
you have to stay at the top.
It's very hard too. So I'm very

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.800
grateful to all the relatives
and people who are close to me,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.480
who help me everyday
to stay at the top.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.160
Your father has always
overseen your career,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.800
you have a very strong
relationship with him.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.240
Yes, we have a very
good relationship.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.560
Although we are father and son,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.800
we are much more friendly than just
a father-son relationship. We talk,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.400
we argue, we share opinions and we
don't always agree with each other.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.760
So we have that a lot. We've
created that since we were little.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.440
This is an advantage that I
think I have over many people,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.840
many friends tell me that the
relationship that I have with

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.680
my father, they've never seen in
their lives and that it's really

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:53.000
different to have him as a father,
to be there by my side, no

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.560
matter how boring he is,
he is a guy that I love too much.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.000
But at a very young age,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.640
you had to move away from
your parents and your sister.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.480
It's the price you had to pay
to succeed in football.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:13.080
Of course, I had many moments when I
stopped doing things that I wanted to

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:20.200
do, like any child at the age of 12,
13. Going to the park or

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.520
going on a trip with school, going
out with some friends to the movies.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.000
For many of them, I couldn't go
because I had training the next day,

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.800
or I had game, or I had to stay
home and take care of myself.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.160
Obviously I stopped enjoying days
with my family when I was away

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.640
for two weeks to play. I missed that.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.520
Today I live away from them,
for a good period of time now.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.280
I miss my mother, my sister,
my father, whenever they can,

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:56.240
they come to visit me.
But I think that's part of life

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.240
for anyone who wants to succeed, you
have to go through difficult times.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.680
You have to get outside
of your comfort zone.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.600
You have to look for something
more or somewhere else,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:13.520
so that you can give a better
life to your relatives.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.400
We don't often speak about the
challenges of a star footballer.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.200
The most marking being
during the World Cup in 2014.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.000
You broke your back.
Were you afraid that the issue

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.400
would leave you with a disability
and to no longer be able to play?

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.080
Yes. It was one of the most
complicated moments of my life.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.160
The back injury that I had.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:43.400
But at the same time it was a relief.
It was also a happy

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:54.400
moment to know that I'd be playing
football again, because when I

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.080
got hurt and went to the hospital,
a doctor came to me and said:

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.840
"You have two pieces of news,
good and bad."

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.480
"Which one do you want first?" I
want the bad. "The bad is that

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:09.120
you're out of the World Cup."
Then I started crying and I said,

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.800
so what's the good one?
"You'll go back to playing football,

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.320
you'll be able to walk
normally again, live your life,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.920
because if it was two inches to the
side you wouldn't have been able to

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:29.480
walk anymore. That really hurt me.
It's something I'm too excited about

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.320
because you take a bump on your
back and for the sake of two inches,

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.240
it could have ended your life,
ended my dreams and

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.400
ended my passion... it's not easy.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:45.400
I suffered at that time and I was
very sad to have been ruled out of

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.960
the  World Cup, but it was a
release and God protected me and

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.880
I was able to play football again.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.120
Neymar can resist anything.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.320
It's his mental strength said
a former director at Santos,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.200
your first club.
He never gives up his dreams.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.680
Is that the message that you send
to the youngsters that follow you?

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.880
I think so, because you have to
believe in everything. I'm a guy who

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.400
doesn't see a lost ball,
doesn't see a lost game.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.480
For me nothing is impossible.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.560
Anything is possible.
I believe in everything,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:28.560
I believe in God and I know that
God can do anything for those

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.720
who believe in him. So since I
believe in him, I can do anything.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.200
I can look to win a game
that seems to be lost.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.440
I can score a goal at the end,

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.440
I can do something
unimaginable for many, and I

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.760
never give up. One

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.360
piece of advice I would give to all
those youngsters that want to become

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.800
footballers is that they should
believe in their dream. Go for it.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.680
Train. Insist.
Persist and

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.360
do everything you can to make
your dream come true.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.320
That's what I did.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.280
And there are of course
failures recently,

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.160
with the Champions League
final defeat for PSG.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.800
Have you digested the disappointment
or is it unforgettable?

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.040
It was bad.
Losing a cup final,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.520
even more so in the Champions League
is pretty bad. I didn't like it.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:30.600
I suffered a lot, I cried, because I
really wanted that title for France.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:39.120
But unfortunately we didn't get it
this time. But we've got another

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:46.440
chance this season and we'll try
everything to get back to the final,

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.920
in search of another title,
which is unprecedented.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.600
It was a very difficult
game that we lost.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:01.800
We were very sad, but it happens,
it's football and it's part of it.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.880
They are a great team.
They were better in that match.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:13.960
I think they deserved it.
But it's part of the game.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:19.240
At PSG, how would you describe
your relationship with Mbappé?

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.240
We are practically brothers.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.600
I'm the older brother and
he's the younger brother.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.560
We mess about a lot,
I'm a guy who shout at him a lot too,

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.360
on the field, mostly I ask
him to run, do this and that.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:42.760
I'm a real pain in the backside,
but I want the best from him. He's a

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:49.360
golden boy, I call him Golden
Boy because he's really special,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.920
he has a huge heart, his quality as
a football player I don't even need

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:59.080
to talk about it. Everybody knows it.
But off the field, he's incredible.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.000
A squad man, he's always smiling,
cheerful, joking around,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.760
he's a lot like me. We need to
be happy to give 100 per cent.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:14.640
So when he's happy on the
field it's hard to stop him,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.800
so I always want

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.080
him to be very happy.
I hope we can have a great

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:28.560
season this year together,
that we can win several titles too.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.800
And are you happy at PSG?
Do you want to stay?

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.200
Yes, I am very happy today.
Something has changed a lot.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:44.160
I don't think I can say exactly
what ended up changing, but I know

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.640
something has changed, I don't know
if it was on my side or other things.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.520
But today I feel good,
I feel more adapted,

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:59.280
more at ease with everything.
I am very happy here.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.840
I want to stay at
Paris Saint-Germain,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.880
I hope Kylian will stay too.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:12.200
It's  the desire of every Paris
fan and I think that's all.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.800
we want to take Paris Saint-Germain
to the top. I want to keep doing what

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:23.880
I've been doing for Paris, which is
playing football and being happy.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:28.720
I have heard that you like to wind
up your teammates and tell jokes...

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.200
I'm a very playful guy, I like
to mess about with my team-mates.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.720
I do so a lot with my friends.
I'm a very happy guy,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:47.360
a very good friend to everyone, I
like to play, to laugh. I get on with

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.240
everyone.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.480
You seem like a man that
likes to party. Is that true?

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.080
That's a different story,

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.120
but who doesn't like to party?
Everybody likes to have fun,

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.920
to go out with their friends,
with their family.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.360
I know when I can go, when I
can do it, I know when I can't.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.400
Quite the opposite of what
people think, that I'm immature,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.440
that I don't know what I am doing.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:27.840
If you stand there one hundred
percent focused on just playing

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:33.960
football, in my way of thinking
and my way of being, you end

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.800
up exploding and that I
will never stop doing.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.400
Neymar, you take a lot of
care in your appearance.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.200
Your clothes, hair and tattoos.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:49.280
Is that another reason that
you are an icon for youngsters?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.560
I don't know because I never
imagined it. I never meant

00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:00.720
for it to be fashionable,
to be something for others to follow.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.480
But it turned out to be that way.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:09.120
The Mohican was one of the first
things I did and a lot of people

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:15.120
started to cut their hair in that
way, some clothes that I wear,

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.520
they also started to wear.
I'm glad it's something

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.200
that people like.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.520
But the Neymar that we know the
least is the one with a huge heart.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.440
In Brazil, you are a idolised,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.120
you opened the Neymar Institute with
your parents for children from poor

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.000
backgrounds and the favelas where
you grew up. Who had this idea?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.040
Very few people really know who I am,

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:51.360
they have more the idea the media
portrays, or on social media...

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:58.200
That idea was one we
had when I was little.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.320
We had the idea to build this,
together with my family,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.280
the idea of my father,
together with my mother,

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.040
who started to explain
what the institute was.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.880
And then I started to understand
exactly what that would mean for us.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:16.000
It's really everything
we dreamed of today.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.800
I think it's even better
than we had dreamed.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:29.680
I wanted to be more present,
but I can't because of the club's

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.920
fixture list and living far away.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.080
But it's something that
was a dream of our family

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.560
that we have managed to achieve.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.600
 
How many children are there?

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:44.840
There are three thousand children,
more or less and overall the

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:50.880
outreach from our relatives, gets
to more than ten thousand people.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.640
We are very happy to be able to help.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.240
The first thing you need to do to
participate in the Institute

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:08.560
is that your students are need to be
going to school, that they do not

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:14.280
miss their classes. The Institute
is in addition to the school.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.920
We help with everything,
physical activities, French,

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:24.200
Spanish, English, robotics,
volleyball and swimming, karate.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.800
Things that help to develop any kind
of child. Having these activities,

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:37.680
extra lessons in other languages,
I think it is very good.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.360
Back home, there are some that say
that you are a hero that hasn't

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.400
forgotten where he came from.
Are you proud of that?

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.040
It's a huge source of pride for me,

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.400
to be recognized like this,
because I've never really

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.880
forgotten where I came from,
I've never forgotten all that I

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.400
learned in that neighborhood,
or in Nautica III. They were places

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.680
that taught me a lot of things,
from the street.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.720
I'm very grateful for that.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.800
And to be able to give back to
the Institute in this way is

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:20.160
something that has no price for me,
something very big indeed. It's the

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:28.640
best goal I could have scored and
I'm very happy to be able to help.
